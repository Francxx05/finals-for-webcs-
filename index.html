            Kara, born into privilege, carries the weight of her family’s expectations. As the heir to a powerful company, she hides her true self behind perfection, bound by duty and fear of disappointing those around her.

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Hello! I’m <strong>Francheska Rivera</strong>, also known online as <strong>“Juno.”</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            My passion for games began when I was ten years old, inspired by the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series created by Square Enix. Their storytelling and artistry fueled my love for creating and sparked my fascination with computers, art, and game development.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            My path hasn’t been a straight one — I’ve been a STEM student, tried architecture, and then shifted after one semester. But through all the uncertainty, one thing stayed constant: my desire to create games and stories that feel alive.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            That dream eventually became <em>Bloom Into You</em>, a project I began in 2021. It started as an idea for an art portfolio but grew into something more personal — a story that reflects my own journey of doubt, growth, and love. To bring it to life, I formed a small creative team called <strong>MisoSheep</strong>, dedicated to turning Bloom into a heartfelt experience others can connect with.
